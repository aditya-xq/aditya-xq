👋 Kon'nichiwa!

I'm a full-stack and applied AI software engineer with 6 years of expertise in React, NextJS, Svelte, NodeJS, and Python across 15+ projects, 150+ technical articles, and 500K+ lines of code. 

"If you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know, but I bet you what? I know how to find the answer, and I will find the answer"
\--The Pursuit of Happyness. 

I firmly believe that any concept is learnable if approached with the right mindset.
