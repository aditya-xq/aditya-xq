I'm particularly fascinated by the possibilities of Generative AI and how it could revolutionize our world.

"If you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know, but I bet you what? I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer" -The Pursuit of Happyness.

"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world." -Robin Williams as John Keats, Dead Poets Society.

"...while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do." -Steve Jobs.
