👋 Hello world!

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for product development, content creation, and exploring the potential of technology.

"If you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know, but I bet you what? I know how to find the answer, and I will find the answer" -The Pursuit of Happyness.

I firmly believe that any concept is learnable if approached with the right mindset.

💡 Here are two quotes that resonate with me:

"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world." -Robin Williams as John Keats, Dead Poets Society.

"...while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do." -Steve Jobs.
